/* Which endpoints carry Bluetooth, read from the chip's own configuration
 * descriptor instead of assumed.
 *
 * The PS5's Bluetooth chip (MediaTek 0e8d:3603) has two HCI functions. Each is
 * a USB interface of class e0/01/01 with an interrupt-IN endpoint (HCI
 * events), a bulk-IN endpoint (ACL from the chip) and a bulk-OUT endpoint
 * (ACL to the chip); a second interface with isochronous endpoints carries
 * voice. Their addresses differ between consoles: on a PS5 fat with firmware
 * 10.01 the events come on 0x81 and the ACL on 0x82, which cost two trials
 * to find out. The rule here is the usual one: the first endpoint of each
 * kind in descriptor order. */
