/* Bluetooth HID host for game controllers, on a controller shared with the
 * console's own driver.
 *
 * Runs on one thread: host_poll() pumps the transport, dispatches what
 * arrived and advances every link's state machine. Every step that needs a
 * reply is retried or timed out, since a few packets go to the system's
 * driver instead of here.
 *
 *   pairing:    host_pair() searches for a pad in pairing mode, connects,
 *               pairs, reads its vendor/product id over SDP and opens the
 *               HID channels. The link key and ids are stored.
 *   reconnect:  a stored pad that is switched on connects by itself; it is
 *               accepted, authenticated with the stored key and its HID
 *               channels accepted or opened.
