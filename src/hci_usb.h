/* HCI over USB to the PS5's Bluetooth chip, alongside the system's driver.
 *
 * What is known about the chip: one USB device, /dev/ugen0.2 (MediaTek
 * 0e8d:3603), with two complete HCI controllers. The system runs the
 * DualSense on the second. The first is opened here without detaching the
 * system's driver, which would take the DualSense down. Its endpoints are
 * read from the chip's configuration descriptor (usb_desc.c): on a PS5 fat
 * with firmware 10.01 the events come on 0x81, ACL in on 0x82, ACL out on
 * 0x01, and commands go on the control endpoint to interface 0. Other consoles may
 * lay the chip out differently.
 *
 * The system's driver keeps reads pending on those endpoints too, so each
 * incoming packet goes to whichever read is first in line. Keeping many
 * reads pending wins most of them; the stack above must cope with the few
 * it loses (it retries, and never relies on a single event arriving).
